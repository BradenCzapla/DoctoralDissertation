abstract = {We propose the idea of a subwavelength-sized light guide represented by a linear chain of spherical metal nanoparticles in which light is transmitted by electrodynamic interparticle coupling. The light-transport properties of this system are investigated by use of model calculations based on generalized Mie theory. Considering Ag particles of 50-nm diameter, we find optimum guiding conditions for an interparticle spacing of 25??nm, and a corresponding 1/e signal-damping length of 900??nm is evaluated. The proposed principle of optical energy transport may be useful for subwavelength transmission lines within integrated optics circuits and for near-field optical microscopy.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates that the scattering cross section per unit length of randomly oriented linear chains of optically soft spheres asymptotically converges toward those of randomly oriented and infinitely long cylinders with volume-equivalent diameter as the number of spheres increases. The critical number of spheres necessary to approximate the linear chains of spheres as infinitely long cylinders decreased rapidly as the size parameter of an individual sphere increased from 0.01 to 10. On the other hand, their absorption cross section per unit length was identical to that of an infinitely long volume-equivalent cylinder for any number of spheres. However, this approximation does not apply to the angle-dependent normalized Stokes scattering matrix element ratios.},

@article{Otey2011,
abstract = {Near-field electromagnetic heat transfer holds great potential for the advancement of nanotechnology. Whereas far-field electromagnetic heat transfer is constrained by Planck's blackbody limit, the increased density of states in the near-field enhances heat transfer rates by orders of magnitude relative to the conventional limit. Such enhancement opens new possibilities in numerous applications, including thermal-photo-voltaics, nano-patterning, and imaging. The advancement in this area, however, has been hampered by the lack of rigorous theoretical treatment, especially for geometries that are of direct experimental relevance. Here we introduce an efficient computational strategy, and present the first rigorous calculation of electromagnetic heat transfer in a sphere-plate geometry, the only geometry where transfer rate beyond blackbody limit has been quantitatively probed at room temperature. Our approach results in a definitive picture unifying various approximations previously used to treat this problem, and provides new physical insights for designing experiments aiming to explore enhanced thermal transfer.},

abstract = {In the near field, radiative heat transfer can exceed the prediction from Planck's law by several orders of magnitude, when the interacting materials support surface polaritons in the infrared range. However, if the emitter and absorber are made from two different materials, which support surface polariton resonances at different frequencies, the mismatch between surface polariton resonance frequencies will drastically reduce near-field radiative heat transfer. Here, we present a broadband near-field thermal emitter/absorber based on hyperbolic metamaterials, which can significantly enhance near-field radiative heat transfer with infrared surfacepolariton- resonance materials and maintain the monochromatic characteristic of heat transfer. Instead of using an effective medium approximation, we perform a direct numerical simulation to accurately investigate the heat transfer mechanisms of metamaterials based on the Wiener chaos expansion method.},

We identify two distinct coupling mechanisms of optical transport in terms of the coupling efficiency between neighboring microspheres, namely, evanescent coupling and nanojet coupling. We demonstrate that perfect whispering gallery mode propagation through a chain of evanescently coupled microspheres can be achieved. However, optical coupling and transport through a chain of nanojet-inducing microspheres is less efficient due to the radiative nature of photonic nanojets. Understanding these two optical coupling mechanisms is critical for selecting appropriate microspheres to build coupled resonator optical waveguides and other photon-manipulation devices for effective and low-loss guiding of photons.},

In the framework of electrodynamics and using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we can evaluate the energy exchange in the near field, which is dominated by the contribution of tunneling waves. The transfer is enhanced by several orders of magnitude if the surface or the particle can support resonant surface waves. An application to local heating is discussed.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are relatively new computational tools that have found extensive utilization in solving many complex real-world problems. The attractiveness of ANNs comes from their remarkable information processing characteristics pertinent mainly to nonlinearity, high parallelism, fault and noise tolerance, and learning and generalization capabilities. This paper aims to familiarize the reader with ANN-based computing (neurocomputing) and to serve as a useful companion practical guide and toolkit for the ANNs modeler along the course of ANN project development. The history of the evolution of neurocomputing and its relation to the field of neurobiology is briefly discussed. ANNs are compared to both expert systems and statistical regression and their advantages and limitations are outlined. A bird's eye review of the various types of ANNs and the related learning rules is presented, with special emphasis on backpropagation (BP) ANNs theory and design. A generalized methodology for developing successful ANNs projects from conceptualization, to design, to implementation, is described. The most common problems that BPANNs developers face during training are summarized in conjunction with possible causes and remedies. Finally, as a practical application, BPANNs were used to model the microbial growth curves of S. flexneri. The developed model was reasonably accurate in simulating both training and test time-dependent growth curves as affected by temperature and pH.},

abstract = {A novel numerical method called the Thermal Discrete Dipole Approximation (T-DDA) is proposed for modeling near-field radiative heat transfer in three-dimensional arbitrary geometries. The T-DDA is conceptually similar to the Discrete Dipole Approximation, except that the incident field originates from thermal oscillations of dipoles. The T-DDA is described in details in the paper, and the method is tested against exact results of radiative conductance between two spheres separated by a sub-wavelength vacuum gap. For all cases considered, the results calculated from the T-DDA are in good agreement with those from the analytical solution. When considering frequency-independent dielectric functions, it is observed that the number of sub-volumes required for convergence increases as the sphere permittivity increases. Additionally, simulations performed for two silica spheres of 0.5$\mu$m-diameter show that the resonant modes are predicted accurately via the T-DDA. For separation gaps of 0.5$\mu$m and 0.2$\mu$m, the relative differences between the T-DDA and the exact results are 0.35{\%} and 6.4{\%}, respectively, when 552 sub-volumes are used to discretize a sphere. Finally, simulations are performed for two cubes of silica separated by a sub-wavelength gap. The results revealed that faster convergence is obtained when considering cubical objects rather than curved geometries. This work suggests that the T-DDA is a robust numerical approach that can be employed for solving a wide variety of near-field thermal radiation problems in three-dimensional geometries.},

The performance of the optimized network architecture, 2:4s:2l, was tested at variable rate constant ratios. The reduced dimensions of the network input space obtained using the Kolmogorov−Sprecher theorem result in improved limits of precision in estimating parameters at near-unity rate constant ratios. Experiments with real kinetic data provided a relative standard error of prediction of 2.47{\%} and 4.23{\%} for the two mixture components. These errors are much smaller than those obtained with existing alternative methods, particularly at the low rate constant ratio involved (1.37).},

abstract = {Resonances in partial waves a n and b n are directly responsible for a ripple structure in the normalized extinction cross section. The distance $\Delta$x in the size parameter between two neighboring resonances is equal to a basic period of a ripple structure. One of the interesting features of the normalized ex­ tinction cross section (efficiency for extinction) for light scattering on spherical particles is the existence of the ripple structure superimposed upon the main oscillations of the extinction curve (Fig. 1). Van de Hulst 1 suggested a "tentative explanation" of the ripple structure in the form of interference between forward diffracted wave and surface waves. The proper mathematical description of the ripple structure has to be contained in the Mie partial-wave expansion of the normalized extinction cross section, where the size parameter x = 2nr/$\lambda$ relates the radius of the sphere r to the wavelength $\lambda$, m is an index of FIG. 1. Normalized extinc­ tion cross section for refrac­ tive index m =1.50 and the size parameter 0 ≤ x≤ 20. The double-peaked structure of the ripple is clearly seen for all x {\textgreater}10. FIG. 2. Real parts of a 13 (x) and b 13 (x) (solid lines) and im­ aginary parts of a 13 (x) and b 13 ($\chi$) (dotted lines) as a function of x. The first sharp peaks represent a 13 and b l3 partial-wave resonances. At the peak we have Re a n = l and Ima n = 0. The width of a resonance at half of maximum intensity is deter­ mined by the points Ima n = 0. 5 and -0. 5. The same is valid for b n resonance. Broad secondary peaks contribute to the formation of smoothly varying background in Q ext {\textperiodcentered} refraction, and a n , b n are usual Mie scattering func­ tions. Because only real parts of the scattering functions a n (x, m) and b n (x,m) appear in Eq. (1) for the normalized extinction cross section Q ext (x, m), and because these real parts are always positive, 2 the ripple structure cannot be a result of any interference phenomena among the partial waves a n and b n . Equation (1) shows that the ripple arises as a result of an algebraic summation of real parts of a n (x, m) and b " (x, m). Therefore, sharp narrow peaks in the ripple structure at definitive val­ ues of the size parameter x can be produced only by sharp narrow peaks in the real parts of the scattering functions a n (x,m) and b n (x, m) at definite values of x. We will call such narrow peaks resonances. We will see later that such narrow peaks in Re(a " (x, m)) and Re(b n (x, m)) occur for sufficiently large x in the neigh­ borhood of x{\~{}}n. In this sense they are analogous to Van de Hulst's surface waves. 3},

For R2 = 40R1, the smallest gap to which we have been able to compute radiative transfer is d = 0.016R1. To accomplish these computations, we have had to modify existing methods for computing near-field radiative transfer between two spheres in the following ways: (1) exact calculations of coefficients of vector translation theorem are replaced by approximations valid for the limit d ≪ R1, and (2) recursion relations for a normalized form of translation coefficients are derived which enable us to replace computations of spherical Bessel and Hankel functions by computations of ratios of spherical Bessel or spherical Hankel functions. The results are then compared with the predictions of the modified proximity approximation.},

To date, experiments have only realized enhancements of ∼100 fold as the smallest gap sizes in radiative heat transfer studies have been limited to ∼50 nm by device curvature and particle contamination. Here, we report a 1,200-fold enhancement with respect to the far-field value in the radiative heat flux between parallel planar silica surfaces separated by gaps as small as ∼25 nm. Achieving such small gap sizes and the resultant dramatic enhancement in near-field energy flux is critical to achieve a number of novel near-field based nanoscale energy conversion systems that have been theoretically predicted but remain experimentally unverified.},

Two-dimensional periodic microstructured surfaces with metal coatings are fabricated with Si anisotropic etching and laser ablation techniques. The structural periods of the samples are 2.0 and 1.5 $\mu$m. Clear selective-emission bands are observed experimentally. This selective emission is attributed to the resonance effect between the emissive field and the surface microstructures. In addition, numerical calculation computed with rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) is performed on the microstructured samples. The selective-emission peaks measured through experiments can be reproduced well by RCWA, and this result suggests strongly that the thermal radiation from periodic structures may have spatial coherence. It is confirmed that the surface microstructure can be applied to the control of spectral emission from high-temperature materials.},

Depending on the substrates, the radiative heat transfer is modulated by the thickness of the ultra thin film. In particular we consider gold thin films with thicknesses varying from 4 to 20 nm. The ultra-thin film has an insulator-conductor transition close to a critical thickness of dc = 6.4 nm and there is an increase in the near field spectral heat transfer just before the percolation transition. Depending on the substrates (Si or SiC) and the thickness of the metallic coatings we show how the near field heat transfer can be increased or decreased as a function of the metallic coating thickness. The calculations are based on available experimental data for the optical properties of ultrathin coatings.},

This model was found to be rather crude for some applications to amorphous solids. A dielectric function model yielding a Gaussian shape of the absorption lines and satisfying Kramers–Kronig relations is suggested. The model function is constructed by a convolution of a Gaussian function with the dielectric function of the damped harmonic oscillator model. An analytical solution of this integral is given. It is demonstrated that this model describes the spectra of thermally grown ultrathin (1.3 nm) silicon oxide films, plasma‐deposited silicon films, plasma‐deposited silicon nitride films, and amorphous aluminum oxide films very well. The physical motivation of the dielectric function model suggested is the randomness of the vibrational frequencies in an amorphous structure.},

Most of the sharp enhancements found in the Fourier transform correspond to geometrical rays associated with the various terms in the Debye-series expansion of the Mie amplitude. However, there are some enhancements that cannot be ascribed to any individual Debye-series term. Instead, they arise from a constructive interference cooperation of the phase of a scattering resonance in a single partial wave with the region of the stationary phase corresponding to geometrical orbiting in the m-internal-reflection portion of the Fourier transform of the scattering amplitude. This phase cooperation amplifies the contribution that the scattering resonance makes to the Fourier-transform amplitude.},

abstract = {A fluctuational electrodynamics-based formalism for calculating near-field radiative heat transfer between objects of arbitrary size and shape and an infinite surface is presented. The surface interactions are treated analytically via Sommerfeld's theory of electric dipole radiation above an infinite plane. The volume integral equation for the electric field is discretized using the thermal discrete dipole approximation (T-DDA). The framework is verified against exact results in the sphere-surface configuration and is applied to analyze near-field radiative heat transfer between a complex-shaped probe and an infinite plane, both made of silica. It is found that, when the probe tip size is approximately equal to or smaller than the gap d separating the probe and the surface, coupled localized surface phonon (LSPh)-surface phonon-polariton (SPhP) mediated heat transfer occurs. In this regime, the net spectral heat rate exhibits four resonant modes due to LSPhs along the minor axis of the probe, while the net total heat rate in the near field follows a d{\^{}}-0.3 power law. Conversely, when the probe tip size is much larger than the separation gap d , heat transfer is mediated by SPhPs, resulting in two resonant modes in the net spectral heat rate, corresponding to those of a single emitting silica surface, while the net total heat rate approaches a d{\^{}}-2 power law. It is also demonstrated that a complex-shaped probe can be approximated by a prolate spheroidal electric dipole when the thermal wavelength is larger than the major axis of the spheroidal dipole and when the separation gap d is much larger than the radius of curvature of the dipole tip facing the surface.},

A unique feature of this work is that the entire analysis is performed on the real frequency axis instead of summation over Matsubara frequencies on the imaginary frequency axis. The expression we obtain for van der Waals energy is a generalization of van Kampen and Schram's result for dissipationless media. By considering a specific case of a vacuum gap between multilayer objects with dissipative films, we show that the van der Waals energy due to the vacuum gap can not be interpreted simply as a sum of free energy of normal modes.},

abstract = {Near-field radiative transfer between two objects can be computed using Rytov's theory of fluctuational electrodynamics in which the strength of electromagnetic sources is related to temperature through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and the resultant energy transfer is described using the dyadic Green's function of the vector Helmholtz equation. When the two objects are spheres, the dyadic Green's function can be expanded in a series of vector spherical waves. Based on comparison with the convergence criterion for the case of radiative transfer between two parallel surfaces, we derive a relation for the number of vector spherical waves required for convergence in the case of radiative transfer between two spheres. We show that when electromagnetic surface waves are active at a frequency the number of vector spherical waves required for convergence is proportional to Rmax/d when d/Rmax → 0, where Rmax is the radius of the larger sphere, and d is the smallest gap between the two spheres. This criterion for convergence applies equally well to other near-field electromagnetic scattering problems.},

abstract = {Air conditioning of dwellings in developing countries is currently rather rare, but increasing personal income is expected to change that. This study examined the potential energy demand for cooling in the 50 most populous metropolitan areas of the world, and assessed the incremental demand in developing countries that this would create on top of the current energy demand due to heating. The analysis used local cooling and heating degree-day data. The main results are as follows: (1) Most of the largest metropolitan areas are in developing countries (38 out of 50), and most of them, in turn, are in warm to hot climates. (2) All but two of the top 30 metropolitan areas in terms of cooling degree days are in developing countries. (3) The potential cooling demands are greater than heating demands in most of the metropolitan areas that are in developing countries (24 out of 38). The main implication of these findings is that increasing personal income is likely to lead to an unprecedented increase in energy demand in many developing countries. For example, the potential cooling demand in metropolitan Mumbai is about 24{\%} of the demand for the entire United States.},

Next we discuss a number of key issues which must be addressed when applying neural networks to practical problems, and highlight several potential pitfalls. Finally, we survey the various classes of problem which may be addressed using neural networks, and we illustrate them with a variety of successful applications drawn from a range of fields. It is intended that this review should be accessible to readers with no previous knowledge of neural networks, and yet also provide new insights for those already making practical use of these techniques.},

The value of Qabs is found to be proportional to n2 over a considerable range of values which are specified. As n2 increases, Qsca first decreases to a minimum value and then passes through a maximum, when x ≫ 1 and for most values of n1. The half-width of the angular intensity function is calculated over a range of values of n1 and n2. This half-width varies as x−1 and x ≥ 10 and is relatively insensitive to the values of n1 and n2.},

abstract = {Standard solar cells heat up under sunlight. The resulting increased temperature of the solar cell has adverse consequences on both its efficiency and its reliability. We introduce a general approach to radiatively lower the operating temperature of a solar cell through sky access, while maintaining its solar absorption. We first present an ideal scheme for the radiative cooling of solar cells. For an example case of a bare crystalline silicon solar cell, we show that the ideal scheme can passively lower its operating temperature by 18.3 K. We then demonstrate a microphotonic design based on real material properties that approaches the performance of the ideal scheme. We also show that the radiative cooling effect is substantial, even in the presence of significant convection and conduction and parasitic solar absorption in the cooling layer, provided that we design the cooling layer to be sufficiently thin.},

@techreport{Emslie1961,
abstract = {The effects are investigated which occur when radiation shields are placed too close to each other. The anticipated effect is that the radiation transfer rate will increase many times. Such effect would be serious in the storage of cryogenic fuels for long periods in space. Effective protection of such fuels from solar radiation requires total shielding consisting of about 100 layers of metal foil. If the shielding is to be of reasonable over-all thickness, the spacing between the individual foils may be about 0.1 mm. Now at a temperature of 20 K the peak of the Planck radiation distribution corresponds to a wavelength of 0.15 mm. Thus the wavelength of the radiation is of the same order of magnitude as the separation of the foils. Under these conditions two effects causing increase in radiation transfer begin to set in. One of these is the effect of constructive interference when the wave emitted by a foil is reflected back and forth in the small gap between two foils. This results in a very considerable increase in transmission of energy across the gap when the spacing is small compared with the wavelength of the radiation. The other effect can be called radiation tunneling and has to do with the escape of trapped radiation that is undergoing total internal reflection inside one of the metal foils.},

Asymmetry is inherent to the uniaxial medium, where the optical axis is tilted with respect to medium interfaces. The use of AHMs is shown to enhance the free-space coupling efficiency of thermally radiated waves, resulting in Super-Planckian far-field thermal emission in certain directions. This effect is impossible in usual hyperbolic materials because emission of high density of states (DOS) photons into vacuum with smaller DOS is preserved by the total internal reflection. Different plasmonic metamaterials are proposed for realizing AHM media; the thermal emission from a AHM, based on a grapheme multilayer structure, is presented, as an example.},

abstract = {A method for calculating the extinction, absorption, and scattering cross sections of clusters of neighboring spheres for both fixed and random orientations is developed. The analysis employs the superposition formulation for radiative interactions among spheres, in which the total field from the cluster is expressed as a superposition of vector spherical harmonic expansions about each of the spheres in the cluster. Through the use of addition theorems a matrix equation for the expansion coefficients is obtained. Further application of addition theorems on the inverse of the coefficient matrix is shown to yield analytical expressions for the orientation-averaged total cross sections of the sphere cluster. Calculations of the cross sections of pairs of spheres and fractal aggregates of several spheres are presented. It is found that a dipole representation of the field in each sphere does not adequately predict the absorption cross section of clusters of small-size-parameter spheres when the spheres are highly conducting. For this situation several multipole orders are required for an accurate calculation of the absorption cross section. In addition, the predicted absorption of sphere clusters can be significantly greater than that estimated from the sum of the isolated-sphere cross sections.},

abstract = {I present a process for manufacturing poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films of thicknesses down to 50 microns. PDMS films are currently fabricated by spin-coating the polymer on a wafer and then manually peeling the film after curing. This is labor-intensive and suffers from low yield, dimensional inaccuracies, tearing and wrinkling. I apply manufacturing principles to the preparation of PDMS to enable more accurate, efficient, and reliable manufacturing. Difficulties in the preparation of PDMS films occur for two reasons: a) the material properties of PDMS are hard to characterize and b) process steps are hard to characterize. In analyzing the functional steps in PDMS manufacture, I first examine the spin-coating process. There has been surprisingly little work on thickness control, and I show how unlike with photoresist, the thickness of the coat can be controlled quite robustly by a judicious choice of process parameters. I also show how second-order variations can be controlled by using an inexpensive interferometric technique developed by our collaborators. I then analyze the physics of peeling and show why initiation, beading and tearing are difficult issues. Furthermore the line of separation of between the film and the wafer is difficult to advance without dynamic effects and micro-slippage. In order to prevent these problems, I introduce two new process concepts. First, I introduce a thin 'scaffold', incorporated in situ between the PDMS film and the substrate during spin-coating, which can start the peel front, eliminate the bead, as well as support the film as it is peeled. I then introduce the use of an adhesive roller actuator with a compressive pre-load which helps peel the film while controlling the peel-front. I show how, by using a ferro-magnetic material, the scaffold can be separated and handled by magnetic attachment. I show how the scaffolding can also incorporate a kinematic coupling for subsequent registration in layering. Finally, I will present experimental results showing thickness metrology, model verification and peeling success.},

abstract = {The optical properties of transparent PDMS polymer materials, which can be integrated into general printed circuit board (PCB) for data communication, are of great interest due to the substantial market expectations for the near future. For the present paper, it was found that the absorption loss in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is mainly caused by the vibrational overtone and combination bands of the CH3-groups of the polymer in the spectral datacom region of 600–900nm. Based on observed positions of fundamental, overtone and combination bands of the methyl-group, as recorded within the mid- and near-infrared spectra, anharmonicity constants and normal vibration frequencies were determined. Thus, an empirical equation for estimating the wavelengths with the most significant intrinsic absorption loss due to the corresponding band positions was formulated, which was found to agree well with the experimental data. In addition, PDMS multimode waveguides were fabricated and the respective optical insertion loss was measured at 850nm, which is commercially used for optical datacom transmission and finally the thermal stability of PDMS multimode waveguides was verified as well.},

abstract = {Recent theory has predicted a superlens that is capable of producing sub-diffraction-limited images. This superlens would allow the recovery of evanescent waves in an image via the excitation of surface plasmons. Using silver as a natural optical superlens, we demonstrated sub-diffraction-limited imaging with 60-nanometer half-pitch resolution, or one-sixth of the illumination wavelength. By proper design of the working wavelength and the thickness of silver that allows access to a broad spectrum of subwavelength features, we also showed that arbitrary nanostructures can be imaged with good fidelity. The optical superlens promises exciting avenues to nanoscale optical imaging and ultrasmall optoelectronic devices.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive approach for tailoring the spectral and angular properties of infrared thermal radiation by using a polymer resonator with molecular vibrational modes, consisting of a polymer thin film on a back-reflective substrate. To precisely design the resonator, we derived the infrared dielectric function of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin film from the measured reflectance spectrum by fitting it with a Gaussian-convoluted Drude{\&}{\#}x2013;Lorentz model while accounting for the inhomogeneous broadening caused by the disordered structure of polymers. Our experimental and numerical characterization confirms that the polymer resonator exhibits spectral shaping from quasi-broadband to narrowband due to the intrinsic molecular vibrational absorption of the polymer. The frequency-isolated and strong molecular vibrational absorption of the carbonyl stretching mode at 1730 cm{\&}{\#}x2212;1 enables the narrowband shaping of the PMMA resonator. In addition, we confirm that the angular-shaping characteristics of this polymer resonator can be tuned, from omnidirectional to strongly angular selective, by changing its polymer film thickness. Modal dispersion analysis reveals that the angle-selectivity of the polymer resonator at an angle of incidence of 80{\&}{\#}x00B0; comes from coupling between the molecular vibrational mode and leaky mode. The proposed infrared radiation management strategy based on molecular vibrational modes of polymers is cost-effective, scalable, and works well with terrestrial matter, including organic compounds and gas molecules, showing promise for applications such as optical gas sensing and radiative thermal management.},

abstract = {In this article, we assess the potential development of energy use for future residential heating and air conditioning in the context of climate change. In a reference scenario, global energy demand for heating is projected to increase until 2030 and then stabilize. In contrast, energy demand for air conditioning is projected to increase rapidly over the whole 2000–2100 period, mostly driven by income growth. The associated CO2 emissions for both heating and cooling increase from 0.8GtC in 2000 to 2.2GtC in 2100, i.e. about 12{\%} of total CO2 emissions from energy use (the strongest increase occurs in Asia). The net effect of climate change on global energy use and emissions is relatively small as decreases in heating are compensated for by increases in cooling. However, impacts on heating and cooling individually are considerable in this scenario, with heating energy demand decreased by 34{\%} worldwide by 2100 as a result of climate change, and air-conditioning energy demand increased by 72{\%}. At the regional scale considerable impacts can be seen, particularly in South Asia, where energy demand for residential air conditioning could increase by around 50{\%} due to climate change, compared with the situation without climate change.},

The second phase is to parameterize the optical functions of each individual layer; several models are reviewed, including effective media, the Lorentz oscillator and a recent parameterization of amorphous semiconductors. The final phase involves the fitting of the spectroscopic ellipsometry data to the model, where different figures of merit of the fitting function are discussed. A proper numerical analysis technique requires that the reduced $\chi$2 be used as the figure of merit, which will result in the proper weighting of data points, and in obtaining meaningful error limits and a measure of the goodness of fit.},

abstract = {Radiative energy transfer between closely spaced bodies is known to be significantly larger than that predicted by classical radiative transfer because of tunneling due to evanescent waves. Theoretical analysis of near--field radiative transfer is mainly restricted to radiative transfer between two half--spaces or spheres treated in the dipole approximation (very small sphere) or proximity force approximation (radius of sphere much greater than the gap). Sphere--sphere or sphere--plane configurations beyond the dipole approximation or proximity force approximation have not been attempted. In this work, the radiative energy transfer between two adjacent non--overlapping spheres of arbitrary diameters and gaps is analyzed numerically. For spheres of small diameter (compared to the wavelength), the results coincide with the dipole approximation. We see that the proximity force approximation is not valid for spheres with diameters much larger than the gap, even though this approximation is well established for calculating forces. From the numerical results, a regime map is constructed based on two non--dimensional length scales for the validity of different approximations.},

For typical dielectric systems, it is shown that these coupled phenomena, which are termed wave interference and radiation tunneling, influence the radiative transfer to the extent that the classical Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law is inadequate to describe the net energy transfer. Since both phenomena are significant only when the distance of separation between the surfaces of the solids is of the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of the radiation, their effect is greatest when the spacing is small. However, the actual magnitude of the difference between the present treatment and the classical approach is a complicated function of the surface spacing, the refractive indexes of the solids, and the temperatures of the solids, and can be as large as an order of magnitude.},

The dielectric coating is assumed to be a SiC or SiO2 film, which is on top of the emitter. The results show that the near-field radiative flux between the plane surfaces can be either diminished or enhanced by the dielectric coating, depending on the thermal radiative properties of the emitter and the receiver. Furthermore, the dielectric coating effect on the near-field radiative flux can be very different from that on the far-field radiative flux. Detailed analysis on the variations of the TE- and TM-wave components of the radiative flux by adding the dielectric coating is provided, along with the physical mechanisms that account for these changes. Dielectric coatings such as SiC and SiO2 films are widely seen in microelectronic structures and nanofabrication devices.

abstract = {Radiative heat transfer (RHT) has a central role in entropy generation and energy transfer at length scales ranging from nanometres to light years1. The blackbody limit2, as established in Max Planck's theory of RHT, provides a convenient metric for quantifying rates of RHT because it represents the maximum possible rate of RHT between macroscopic objects in the far field—that is, at separations greater than Wien's wavelength3. Recent experimental work has verified the feasibility of overcoming the blackbody limit in the near field4–7, but heat-transfer rates exceeding the blackbody limit have not previously been demonstrated in the far field. Here we use custom-fabricated calorimetric nanostructures with embedded thermometers to show that RHT between planar membranes with sub-wavelength dimensions can exceed the blackbody limit in the far field by more than two orders of magnitude. The heat-transfer rates that we observe are in good agreement with calculations based on fluctuational electrodynamics. These findings may be directly relevant to various fields, such as energy conversion, atmospheric sciences and astrophysics, in which RHT is important.},

By full solution, we mean that no assumption (e.g. Rayleigh scattering, geometrical optics, weak scattering, Born single scattering, etc.) is necessary regarding the properties of the scatterers, their distribution or the background medium. The algorithm is also fast in the sense that it scales linearly with the number of unknowns. We use this algorithm to study the phenomenon of super-resolution in time-reversal refocusing in highly-scattering media recently observed experimentally (Lemoult et al., 2011), and provide numerical arguments towards the fact that such a phenomenon can be explained through a homogenization theory.},

The expression for LDOS is obtained by relating the electromagnetic energy density at any location in a medium at uniform temperature T to the electric and magnetic DGFs. The appropriate boundary conditions governing the DGFs are obtained and it is seen that the two types of DGFs are electromagnetic duals of each other. With this the concept of LDOS is also extended to material media. The LDOS is split into two terms—one that originates from the energy density in an infinite, homogeneous medium and the other that takes into account scattering from inhomogeneities. The second part can always be defined unambiguously, even in lossy materials. For lossy materials, the first part is finite only if spatial dispersion is taken into account.},

Both require a small spot with a periodic pattern on the surface of the solid, collimated monochromatic light, and a rotation stage. We demonstrate the methods on a polydimethylsiloxane film (Sylgard{\textregistered} 184) and compare our data to those obtained with a standard Abbe refractometer at several wavelengths between 489 and 688 nm. The results of our approaches show good agreement with the refractometer data. Possible error sources are analyzed and discussed in detail; they include mainly the linewidth of the laser and/or the angular resolution of the rotation stage. With narrow-band light sources, an angular accuracy of ±0.025∘ results in an error of the refractive index of typically ±5 ⋅ 10−4. Information on the sample thickness is not required.},

The set of data has been extended both toward shorter and longer wavelengths with data in the literature, along with inter- and extrapolations, in order to obtain a self-consistent set of data by means of Kramers–Kr{\"{o}}nig analysis. All data correspond to films that were deposited by sputtering on nonheated substrates, and hence they are expected to be amorphous. A bandgap of 1.9 eV for the films was fitted from the obtained optical constants. A good global accuracy of the data was estimated through the use of various sum rules. The consistent dataset includes the visible to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV); this large spectrum of characterization will enable the design of multilayer coatings that combine a high reflectance in parts of the EUV with desired performance at a secondary range, such as the visible. To our knowledge, this paper provides the first compilation of the optical constants of amorphous SiC films.},

abstract = {Enhancement of near-field radiative emission via coupling of surface plasmons in nano-gaps formed between thin films is important for understanding and implementation of energy harvesting using nano-thermophotovoltaic cells. Design and construction of such cells need to be carried out along with detailed modeling studies, necessitating accurate calculation of near-field emission within thin films. The objective of this paper is to provide a methodology based on finite difference time domain analysis for the calculation of the near-field thermal radiation emission based on local density of electromagnetic states. Near-field thermal emission is investigated within the nano-gap formed between thin silicon carbide layers where both support surface phonon polaritons. Modeling of this problem with the FDTD method is not trivial particularly for establishing the Drude–Lorentz permittivity model and the selection of the right boundary conditions. We present an effective boundary condition, for calculation of Local Density Of electromagnetic States (LDOS) via Finite Difference Time Domain Method (FDTD) for applications to nano-scale geometries. We conclude that Convolutional Perfectly Matched Layer (CPML) is the optimum boundary condition that gives the most accurate results compared against the other methodologies for parallel plates separated by nano-gaps. This boundary condition allows more streamlined simulations to be carried out when working with sub-wavelength structures. The challenges and the possible solutions to overcome these difficulties are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {We explore in the present work the near-field radiative heat transfer between two semi-infinite parallel nonlocal dielectric planes by means of fluctuational electrodynamics. We use a theory for the nonlocal dielectric permittivity function proposed by Halevi and Fuchs. This theory has the advantage to include different models performed in the literature. According to this theory, the nonlocal dielectric function is described by a Lorenz-Drude like single oscillator model, in which the spatial dispersion effects are represented by an additional term depending on the square of the total wavevector k. The theory takes into account the scattering of the electromagnetic excitation at the surface of the dielectric material, which leads to the need of additional boundary conditions in order to solve Maxwell׳s equations and treat the electromagnetic transmission problem. The additional boundary conditions appear as additional surface scattering parameters in the expressions of the surface impedances. It is shown that the nonlocal modeling deviates from the classical 1/d2 law in the nanometer range at distances still larger than the ones where quantum effects are expected to come into play.},

We show that the rate of spectral emission from a specific sphere in the ensemble and the rate at which emission is exchanged between a pair of spheres can be deduced from the application of reciprocity and energy conservation principles to the solution of Maxwell's time harmonic wave equations for a sphere ensemble that is exposed to a plane wave incident field of wavelength $\lambda$. We show that in the limit of d∕$\lambda$→0, the emissive exchange between a pair of spheres becomes inversely proportional to the gap thickness d. We also show that when the spheres are in the mutual far-field zones of each other, the emissive exchange between the spheres can be well approximated by geometric configuration factors, with an effective area correction to account for finite wavelength effects.},

abstract = {The Mie coefficients and the electric‐field vector inside a spherical, layered particle are presented in a form which is more suitable for computations. Difficulties in the computation occur especially for large, absorbing spheres, due to numerical instabilities in the computation of Besselfunctions with complex arguments. This can be avoided by rearranging the Mie coefficients, so that only ratios and logarithmic derivatives of Besselfunctions are used. A suitable analytical expression for the coefficients of the scattered and transmitted fields and the electric‐field vector is given.},

Our structures are numerically modeled and experimentally characterized by reflection and angularly resolved thermal emission spectroscopy. We demonstrate strong and controllable absorption resonances across the mid-IR wavelength range. In addition, the polarized thermal emission from these samples is shown to be highly selective and largely independent of emission angles from normal to 45°. Experimental results are compared to numerical models with excellent agreement. Such structures hold promise for large-area, low-cost metamaterial coatings for control of gray- or black-body thermal signatures, as well as for possible mid-IR sensing applications.},

@article{Tzarouchis2017,
abstract = {In the present article the classical problem of electromagnetic scattering by a single homogeneous sphere is revisited. Main focus is the study of the scattering behavior as a function of the material contrast and the size parameters for all electric and magnetic resonances of a dielectric sphere. Specifically, the Pad$\backslash$'e approximants are introduced and utilized as an alternative system expansion of the Mie coefficients. Low order Pad$\backslash$'e approximants can give compact and physically insightful expressions for the scattering system and the enabled dynamic mechanisms. Higher order approximants are used for predicting accurately the resonant pole spectrum. These results are summarized into general pole formulae, covering up to fifth order magnetic and forth order electric resonances of a small dielectric sphere. Additionally, the connection between the radiative damping process and the resonant linewidth is investigated. The results obtained reveal the fundamental connection of the radiative damping mechanism with the maximum width occurring for each resonance. Finally, the suggested system ansatz is used for studying the resonant absorption maximum through a circuit-inspired perspective.},

@article{Petersen2013,
abstract = {A closed form expression for the local density of electromagnetic states (LDOS) due to a thermally emitting metamaterial bulk is derived from Maxwell's equations combined with fluctuational electrodynamics. The final form is the same as that for nonmagnetic materials, where the influence of the magnetic permeability is embedded in the Fresnel reflection coefficients. Spectral distributions of LDOS near metallic- and dielectric-based metamaterials are investigated. Results reveal that LDOS profiles are dominated by surface polaritons (SPs) in both TE and TM polarization states. A detailed discussion is provided on the necessary conditions for exciting TM- and TE-polarized SPs via a dispersion relation analysis that accounts for losses. Beyond the conventional conditions for excitation of SPs, the lossy dispersion relation analysis demonstrates mathematically that SPs exist when the imaginary parts of the permittivity or permeability, as well as n′n″, are close to zero, where n′ and n″ are the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, respectively. An asymptotic expression for the extreme near field LDOS is derived, showing a $\Delta$−3 power law relationship, as for nonmagnetic media, between LDOS and distance from the emitting bulk $\Delta$. Results obtained from this study will assist in assessing material properties of arbitrarily electromagnetic materials in applications related to energy harvesting.},

We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine.

We show that the super-Planckian emission of such metamaterials can either come from the presence of surface phonon-polariton modes or from a continuum of hyperbolic modes depending on the choice of composite materials as well as the structural configuration.},

abstract = {Recent works have demonstrated that daytime radiative cooling under direct sunlight can be achieved using multilayer thin films designed to emit in the infrared atmospheric transparency window while reflecting visible light. Here, we demonstrate that a polymer-coated fused silica mirror, as a near-ideal blackbody in the mid-infrared and near-ideal reflector in the solar spectrum, achieves radiative cooling below ambient air temperature under direct sunlight (8.2 °C) and at night (8.4 °C). Its performance exceeds that of a multilayer thin film stack fabricated using vacuum deposition methods by nearly 3 °C. Furthermore, we estimate the cooler has an average net cooling power of about 127 W m–2 during daytime at ambient temperature even considering the significant influence of external conduction and convection, more than twice that reported previously. Our work demonstrates that abundant materials and straightforward fabrication can be used to achieve daytime radiative cooling, advancing applications such ...},

abstract = {In metal optics gold assumes a special status because of its practical importance in optoelectronic and nano-optical devices, and its role as a model system for the study of the elementary electronic excitations that underlie the interaction of electromagnetic fields with metals. However, largely inconsistent values for the frequency dependence of the dielectric function describing the optical response of gold are found in the literature. We performed precise spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on evaporated gold, template-stripped gold, and single-crystal gold to determine the optical dielectric function across a broad spectral range from 300 nm to 25 $\mu$m (0.05–4.14 eV) with high spectral resolution. We fit the data to the Drude free-electron model, with an electron relaxation time $\tau$D=14±3 fs and plasma energy ℏ$\omega$p=8.45 eV. We find that the variation in dielectric functions for the different types of samples is small compared to the range of values reported in the literature. Our values, however, are comparable to the aggregate mean of the collection of previous measurements from over the past six decades. This suggests that although some variation can be attributed to surface morphology, the past measurements using different approaches seem to have been plagued more by systematic errors than previously assumed.},

We study in particular the field emitted at subwavelength distances of material surfaces. After reviewing the main properties of surface waves, we introduce the fluctuation–dissipation theorem that allows to model the fluctuating electromagnetic fields. We then analyse the contribution of these waves in a variety of phenomena. They give a leading contribution to the density of electromagnetic states, they produce both temporal coherence and spatial coherence in the near field of planar thermal sources. They can be used to modify radiative properties of surfaces and to design partially spatially coherent sources. Finally, we discuss the role of surface waves in the radiative heat transfer and the theory of dispersion forces at the subwavelength scale.},

abstract = {We present a detailed derivation of heat radiation, heat transfer, and (Casimir) interactions for N arbitrary objects in the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics in thermal nonequilibrium. The results can be expressed as basis-independent trace formulas in terms of the scattering operators of the individual objects. We prove that heat radiation of a single object is positive, and that heat transfer (for two arbitrary passive objects) is from the hotter to a colder body. The heat transferred is also symmetric, exactly reversed if the two temperatures are exchanged. Introducing partial wave expansions, we transform the results for radiation, transfer, and forces into traces of matrices that can be evaluated in any basis, analogous to the equilibrium Casimir force. The method is illustrated by (re)deriving the heat radiation of a plate, a sphere, and a cylinder. We analyze the radiation of a sphere for different materials, emphasizing that a simplification often employed for metallic nanospheres is typically invalid. We derive asymptotic formulas for heat transfer and nonequilibrium interactions for the cases of a sphere in front a plate and for two spheres, extending previous results. As an example, we show that a hot nanosphere can levitate above a plate with the repulsive nonequilibrium force overcoming gravity, an effect that is not due to radiation pressure.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive solution to the classical problem of electromagnetic scattering by aggregates of an arbitrary number of arbitrarily configured spheres that are isotropic and homogeneous but may be of different size and composition. The profile of incident electromagnetic waves is arbitrary. The analysis is based on the framework of the Mie theory for a single sphere and the existing addition theorems for spherical vector wave functions. The classic Mie theory is generalized. Applying the extended Mie theory to all the spherical constituents in an aggregate simultaneously leads to a set of coupled linear equations in the unknown interactive coefficients. We propose an asymptotic iteration technique to solve for these coefficients. The total scattered field of the entire ensemble is constructed with the interactive scattering coefficients by the use of the translational addition theorem a second time. Rigorous analytical expressions are derived for the cross sections in a general case and for all the elements of the amplitude-scattering matrix in a special case of a plane-incident wave propagating along the z axis. As an illustration, we present some of our preliminary numerical results and compare them with previously published laboratory scattering measurements.},

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based polymers have already been used in the optical communication field, where passive polymer multimode waveguides are required for short-distance datacom optical applications. For such purpose, materials with low intrinsic absorption losses within the spectral region of 600–900nm wavelengths are essential. For vibrational absorption band assignments, especially in the visible and short-wave near-infrared region, the mid-infrared and Raman spectra were investigated for fundamental vibrations of the siloxane materials, shedding light onto the chemistry before and after material polymerization. Within the near-infrared and long-wave visible spectral range, vibrational CH stretching overtone and combination bands dominate the spectra, rendering an optical characterization of core and clad materials. Such knowledge also provides information for the synthesis and optical characterization, e.g., of deuterated derivatives with less intrinsic absorption losses from molecular vibrations compared to the siloxane materials studied.},

abstract = {A general formalism for calculating the radiative heat transfer in many body systems with anisotropic component is presented. Our scheme extends the theory of radiative heat transfer in isotropic many body systems to anisotropic cases. In addition, the radiative heating of the particles by the thermal bath is taken into account in our formula. It is shown that the radiative heat exchange (HE) between anisotropic particles and their radiative cooling/heating (RCH) could be enhanced several order of magnitude than that of isotropic particles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both the HE and RCH can be tuned dramatically by particles relative orientation in many body systems.},

Monolayer graphene could play a vital role in this process owing to its strong infrared plasmonic response, however, which still lacks an experimental verification due to the technical challenges. Here, we manage to make a direct measurement about plasmon-mediated thermal radiation between two macroscopic graphene sheets using a custom-made setup. Super-Planckian radiation with efficiency 4.5 times larger than the blackbody limit is observed at a 430-nm vacuum gap on insulating silicon hosting substrates. The positive role of graphene plasmons is further confirmed on conductive silicon substrates which have strong infrared loss and thermal emittance. Based on these, a thermophotovoltaic cell made of the graphene–silicon heterostructure is lastly discussed. The current work validates the classic thermodynamical theory in treating graphene and also paves a way to pursue the application of near-field thermal management.},

The empirical literature has shown significant increases in climate-driven impacts on overall consumption, yet has not focused on the cost implications of the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events driving peak demand, which is the highest load observed in a period. We use comprehensive, high-frequency data at the level of load balancing authorities to parameterize the relationship between average or peak electricity demand and temperature for a major economy. Using statistical models, we analyze multiyear data from 166 load balancing authorities in the United States. We couple the estimated temperature response functions for total daily consumption and daily peak load with 18 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change-driven impacts on both outcomes. We show moderate and heterogeneous changes in consumption, with an average increase of 2.8{\%} by end of century. The results of our peak load simulations, however, suggest significant increases in the intensity and frequency of peak events throughout the United States, assuming today's technology and electricity market fundamentals. As the electricity grid is built to endure maximum load, our findings have significant implications for the construction of costly peak generating capacity, suggesting additional peak capacity costs of up to 180 billion dollars by the end of the century under business-as-usual.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that liquid metals support surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) at terahertz (THz) frequencies, and can thus serve as an attractive material system for a wide variety of plasmonic and metamaterial applications. We use eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) as the liquid metal injected into a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold fabricated by soft lithography techniques. Using this approach, we observe enhanced THz transmission through a periodic array of subwavelength apertures. Despite of the fact that the DC conductivity of EGaIn is an order of magnitude smaller than many conventional metals, we clearly observe well-defined transmission resonances. This represents a first step in developing reconfigurable and tunable plasmonic devices that build upon well-developed microfluidic capabilities.},

The analysis results in a set of linear equations for the unknown, vector, wave amplitudes of the dGf; that set is solved by truncation and matrix inversion. The theory is exact in the sense that no simplifying assumptions are made in the analytical steps leading to the dGf, and it is general in the sense that any number, position, size and electrical properties can be considered for the spheres that cluster together. The point source can be anywhere, even within one of the spheres. Energy conservation, reciprocity, and other tests prove that this solution is correct. Numerical results are presented for an electric Hertz dipole radiating in the presence of an array of rexolite spheres, which manifests lensing and beam-forming capabilities.},

abstract = {Thermal radiation is one of the most universal physical phenomena, and its study has played a key role in the history of modern physics. Our understanding of this subject has been traditionally based on Planck's law, which in particular sets limits on the amount of thermal radiation that can be emitted or exchanged. However, recent advances in the field of radiative heat transfer have defied these limits, and a plethora of novel thermal phenomena have been discovered that in turn hold the promise to have an impact in technologies that make use of thermal radiation. Here we review the rapidly growing field of radiative heat transfer, paying special attention to the remaining challenges and identifying future research directions. In particular, we focus on the recent work on near-field radiative heat transfer, including (i) experimental advances, (ii) theoretical proposals to tune, actively control, and manage near-field thermal radiation, and (iii) potential applications.

The method is based on the solution of dyadic Green's functions, where the amplitude of the fields in each layer is calculated via a scattering matrix approach. Several tests are presented where cubic boron nitride is used in the simulations. It is shown that a film emitter thicker than 1$\mu$m provides the same spectral distribution of near-field radiative flux as obtained from a bulk emitter. Further simulations have pointed out that the presence of a body in close proximity to an emitter can alter the near-field spectrum emitted. This algorithm can be employed to study thermal one-dimensional layered media and photonic crystals in the near-field in order to design radiators optimizing the performances of nanoscale-gap thermophotovoltaic power generators.},

@article{Edalatpour2016a,
abstract = {A general near-field thermal electromagnetic transport formalism that is independent of the size, shape and number of heat sources is derived. The formalism is based on fluctuational electrodynamics, where fluctuating currents due to thermal agitation are added to Maxwell's curl equations, and is thus valid for heat sources in local thermodynamic equilibrium. Using a volume integral formulation, it is shown that the proposed formalism is a generalization of the classical electromagnetic scattering framework in which thermal emission is implicitly assumed to be negligible. The near-field thermal electromagnetic transport formalism is afterwards applied to a problem involving three spheres with size comparable to the wavelength, where all multipolar interactions are taken into account. Using the thermal discrete dipole approximation, it is shown that depending on the dielectric function, the presence of a third sphere slightly affects the spatial distribution of power absorbed compared to the two-sphere case. A transient analysis shows that despite a non-uniform spatial distribution of power absorbed, the sphere temperature remains spatially uniform at any instant due to the fact that the thermal resistance by conduction is much smaller than the resistance by radiation. The formalism proposed in this paper is general, and could be used as a starting point for adapting solution methods employed in traditional electromagnetic scattering problems to near-field thermal electromagnetic transport.},

abstract = {As the tropics and subtropics become increasingly urban, industrial and affluent, energy demands for thermal comfort may evolve differently than they have historically across the global North. Already, heating, ventilation and air conditioning account for 35{\%} of total primary energy in the United States, and are expected to reach similar proportions in China within 5 years. With increasing population in high temperature areas, electricity demand for increased air-conditioning usage may drive extreme electricity peak demands and total usage. This paper presents comparative estimates of peak and annual electric cooling and heating electricity usage at the city-scale, including both OECD and non-OECD member cities. Our results indicate that mature urban economies of the OECD exhibit a cooling electricity response of 35–90 Watts per °C per capita above room temperature for cooling (interquartile range of estimates). Tropical/subtropical cities outside the OECD (mostly in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East) currently demand just 2–9 W/°C/capita, indicating significant growth in temperature-dependent electricity demand as air conditioning is adopted. A similar story is unfolding on the heating side, with subtropical cities adopting electric resistive heaters, potentially precipitating additional electricity generation and delivery concerns, particularly electric resistance heating is adopted instead of heat pumps.},

Here the usual transfer matrix was modified to a generic form, with the ability to use the absolute squares of the Fresnel coefficients, so as to include incoherent (thick layers) and partially coherent (rough surface or interfaces) reflection and transmission. The method is integrated by use of models for refractive-index depth profiling. The utility of the method is illustrated with various multilayer structures formed by ion implantation into Si, including buried insulating and conducting layers, and multilayers with a thick incoherent layer in an arbitrary position.},

abstract = {Calculations of spectral radiance are reported from several model atmospheres appropriate to different climatic conditions by use of the LOWTRAN 5 computer code. From these data we evaluate the radiative cooling power and the temperature drop below ambient temperature for horizontal surfaces that radiate toward the sky. The surfaces are ideal blackbodies or have ideal infrared-selective properties with zero reflectance in the 8–13-$\mu$m range and unity reflectance elsewhere. For freely radiating surfaces, the cooling power at ambient temperature lies between 58 Wm−2 and 113 Wm−2 for the different surfaces and model atmospheres. The maximum temperature difference for a device with a nonradiative heat transfer coefficient of 1 Wm−2 K−1 is between 11 and 21°C for a blackbody and between 18 and 33°C for an infrared-selective surface. For radiators arranged so that they intercept only the atmospheric zenith radiance, the cooling powers and temperature differences are higher than for freely radiating surfaces, the increase being largest for humid atmospheres. The influence of altered contents of water vapor was found to affect strongly the radiative cooling, whereas changes in ozone and aerosol abundance were less important. The significance of these results to different cooling applications is briefly discussed.},

@article{Francoeur2008,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to discuss the role of fluctuational electrodynamics in the context of a generalized radiative heat transfer problem. Near-field effects, including the interference phenomenon and radiation tunneling, are important for applications to nanostructures. The classical theory of radiative transfer cannot be readily applied as the feature size approaches the dominant wavelength of radiative emission. At all length scales, however, propagation of radiative energy is properly represented by the electromagnetic wave approach, which requires the solution of the Maxwell equations. Fluctuational electrodynamics provides a model for thermal emission when solving a near-field radiation heat transfer problem, and the fluctuation–dissipation theorem provides the bridge between the strength of the fluctuations of the charges inside a body and its local temperature. This paper provides a complete and systematic derivation of the near-field radiative heat flux starting from the Maxwell equations. An illustrative example of near-field versus far-field radiation heat transfer is presented, and the length scale for transition from near- to far-field regime is discussed; the results show that this length scale can be as large as three times than predicted from Wien's law.},

The refractive indices for each grade were obtained from multiple measurements with different film thicknesses on Si substrates. The absorbances of Teflon{\textregistered} AF films were determined by measuring the transmission intensity of Teflon{\textregistered} AF films on CaF2 substrates. In addition to the refractive index and absorbance per cm (base 10), the extinction coefficient (k), and absorption coefficient (a) per cm (base e), Urbach parameters of absorption edge position and edge width, and two-pole Sellmeier parameters were determined for the three grades of Teflon{\textregistered} AF. We found that the optical properties of the three grades of Teflon{\textregistered} AF varied systematically with the AF TFE/PDD composition. The indices of refraction, extinction coefficient (k), absorption coefficient (a), and absorbance (A) increased, as did the TFE content, while the PDD content decreased. In addition, the Urbach edge position moved to a longer wavelength, and the Urbach edge width became wider.},

In addition, further substantial improvements in speed can be obtained by using special purpose hardware implementations of the network, thus making the technique suitable for use in fast real‐time applications.

Composite samples are prepared, and characterised with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The samples exhibit significantly reduced dielectric loss, with a maximum reduction of 15.3{\%} in loss tangent reported for a sample that is 40{\%} PTFE by mass. Results are found to have reasonable agreement with the Lichtenecker logarithmic mixture formula, and any deviation can be accounted for by agglomeration of dopant micro/nano-particles.

abstract = {The theory of electromagnetic fluctuations as developed by Rytov was used to calculate the radiant power as a function of frequency radiated from a homogeneous isothermal sphere. The formula obtained is valid for all radii, frequencies, and complex dielectric constants. It is also shown that the emission coefficient computed from this theory is precisely equal to the absorption coefficient computed from the Mie theory. The formula obtained is readily adaptable to numerical calculations, and results are presented for the case of a good conducting sphere with a wide range of size parameters.},

@article{Cardenas-Valencia2006,
abstract = {The design and optimization of light-based analytical devices often require optical characterization of materials involved in their construction. With the aim of benefiting lab-on-a-chip applications, a transmission spectrometric method for determining refractive indices, n, of transparent solids is presented here. Angular dependence of the reflection coefficient between material–air interfaces constitutes the basis of the procedure. Firstly, the method is studied via simulation, using a theoretical algorithm that describes the light propagation through the sample slide, to assess the potentially attainable accuracy. Simulations also serve to specify the angles at which measurements should be taken. Secondly, a visible light source and an optical fiber spectrometer are used to perform measurements on three commonly used materials in optical lab-on-a-chip devices. A nonlinear regression subroutine fits experimental data to the proposed theoretical model and is used to obtain n. Because the attainable precision using this method of refractive index determination is dictated by the uncertainty in the transmission measurements, the precision (with 95{\%} confidence) for mechanically rigid samples, namely glass and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), is higher than those estimated for the elastomer sample (in-house-molded poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)). At wavelengths with the highest signal-to-noise ratio for the spectrometer setup, the estimated refractive indices were 1.43 ± 0.05 (580 nm) for PDMS, 1.54 ± 0.02 (546 nm) for glass, and 1.485 ± 0.005 (656 nm) for PMMA. Accurate refractive index estimations with an average precision equal to 0.01 refractive index units (RIU) were obtained for PMMA and glass samples, and an average precision of 0.09 RIU for the PDMS molded slide between 550 and 750 nm was obtained.},

abstract = {Radiative heat transfer in systems with core-shell nanoparticles may exhibit not only a combination of disparate physical properties of its components but also further enhanced properties that arise from the synergistic properties of the core and shell components. We study the thermal conductance between two core-shell nanoparticles (CSNPs). The contribution of electric and magnetic dipole moments to the thermal conductance depend sensitively on the core and shell materials, and adjustable by core size and shell thickness. We predict that the radiative heat transfer in a dimer of Au@SiO2 CSNPs (i.e., silica-coated gold nanoparticles) could be enhanced several order of magnitude compared to bare Au nanoparticles. However, the reduction of several orders of magnitude in the heat transfer is possible between SiO2@Au CSNPs (i.e., silica as a core and gold as a shell) than that of uncoated SiO2 nanoparticles.},
